# Andrew G. West - practicalities.txt - From an academic perspective, it is
# desireable to keep the reputation model focused on spatio-temporal 
# properties and have few exceptions to the the general rules set forth.
#
# In reality, this makes a tool with a low hit-rate, does not optimize its
# vandalism seeking opportunities, and is unlikely to be adopted by
# general-purpose (Wikipedia) users. This document outlines the model 'quirks'
# used to optimize performance -- sometimes at the expense of robust-ness.

  [1]:  Some properties of METADATA are highly indicative of the fact an edit
        is NOT vandalism, yet are too lightweight or rare to be included as
        features. For example, edits reverting vandalism with comments of the
        form "undid edit x by y" are sometimes highly-scored (erroneously) on
        the basis of their article reptuation. The [should_queue()] method of 
        [edit_process_thread.java] handles these technicalities.
        
  [2]:  As much as our research hypes spatio-temporal properties. language-
        based ones can be pretty darn effective. Thus, to improve our hit-rate,
        we've decided to include a small number of trivial NLP features.
        These features are built in [feature_language.java] -- and if one
        wanted to compile a "pure" version of STiki without such features,
        a switch is available in [feature_builder.java]. Further, the
        normalization of such features is handled quite informally.
